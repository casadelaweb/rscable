  <!--      <p>-->
  <!--        I shudder to recall that dreadful Diwali night of October 2007, when my mother knocked our-->
  <!--        bed room at the dead of the night enquiring where the toilet was. She looked disoriented and-->
  <!--        totally confused. Unable to understand the cause for her abnormal behaviour, we thought she-->
  <!--        was still in a semi-sleep state and showed her the toilet. But even after coming out of-->
  <!--        toilet she was unable to find her way to her bed room.-->

  <!--  <div class="section">-->
  <!--    <div class="p fixed">-->
  <!--      Sensing that something is seriously amiss, we took her next day to the nearby nursing-->
  <!--      home for diagnosis and treatment. She was immediately referred to a neurosurgeon and after a-->
  <!--      MRI-->
  <!--      scan it was confirmed that she suffered a brain stroke. The report showed certain grey patches-->
  <!--      which the doctor referred to as clots have affected her memory totally. The doctor informed-->
  <!--      that-->
  <!--      the memory loss is irreversible due to her old age. He, however, assured that further, damage-->
  <!--      to-->
  <!--      the brain can be arrested with drugs.-->

  <!--    <div class="p fixed">That was the beginning of the slow end for my mother. As the disease got-->
  <!--      worsened, she-->
  <!--      forgot everything. Lost control of her body functions and finally, failed to recognize anyone-->
  <!--      except my wife who used to take care of her like a mother taking care of her baby. She used to-->
  <!--      feed her, change her diapers, dress her, give her bath, brush her hair, and also help her to-->

  <!--      For my wife and me, she was like a little child. Our world revolved around her. We used-->
  <!--      to play with her, tease her. We even celebrated her 80th birth day with a grand cake cutting-->
  <!--      ceremony attended by my wife’s friends in Kolkata. It was a moment of happiness for her as she-->
  <!--      kept smiling at every one greeting her on her birth day without knowing whose birth day it-->
  <!--      was. So-->
  <!--      when one of the guests greeted her with a “wish you a happy birth day”, she promptly responded-->
